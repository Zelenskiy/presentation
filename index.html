          <h2> What is a browser extension API </h2>
          <p>A browser extension API is a set of programming interfaces provided by web browsers for developing
            extensions to modify and enhance browser functionality.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2> Definition of API </h2>
          <p>An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and tools that allows software
            applications to communicate with each other by defining methods and data structures for interaction.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2> Role of browser extension APIs </h2>
          <p>Browser extension APIs enable developers to extend the functionality of web browsers by providing access to
            browser features and resources, allowing for the creation of custom functionalities.</p>

          <h2> How browser extensions work</h2>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2> Principle of extension operation </h2>
          <p>Browser extensions operate by injecting custom scripts into web pages, interacting with the browser through
            APIs to modify page content and behavior. They can also run background scripts independently of the active
            web page</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2> Extension life cycle: installation, usage, removal </h2>
          <p>The extension life cycle consists of installation, where users add the extension to their browser, followed
            by usage, during which the extension enhances the browsing experience. Eventually, users may choose to
            remove the extension from their browser.</p>

          <h2>How to Write Your Own Basic Browser Extension</h2>
          <p>Now let's start by writing a very basic extension.</p>
          <p>
            To begin, we'll create a folder inside which we create a file
            named <code class="hljs javascript">manifest.json</code>
          </p>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What is a manifest file?</h2>
          <p>
            A manifest file is required for any browser extension. This file
            contains basic data about our extension, such as name, version,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>Now copy the following fragment into the manifest.json file:</p>
          <pre>
              <code
                data-id="code-animation" class="hljs javascript"  data-trim data-line-numbers>
                  {
                    "manifest_version":2,
                    "version":"1.0",
                    "name":"Test",
                  }
              </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How to load the extension file</h2>
          <p>For Chrome users:</p>
          <p>In the address bar search for this: chrome://extensions</p>

          <p>Enable Developer Mode and switch into it</p>
          <p>
            Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            You've installed the extension successfully. But the extension
            doesn't do anything currently. Now let's add some functionality to
            our extension.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>To do this, we'll edit our manifest.json file like this:</p>
          <pre>
              <code
                data-id="code-animation" class="hljs javascript"  data-trim data-line-numbers>
                {
                  "manifest_version":2,
                  "version":"1.0",
                  "name":"Test",
                  "content_scripts":[
                    {
                     "matches":["&lt;all_urls&gt;"],
                     "js":["main.js"]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            In the above code, we added a content script to manifest.json.
            Content scripts can manipulate the Document Object Model of the
            web page. We can inject JS (and CSS) into a web page using a
            content script.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            "matches" contains the list of domains and subdomains where the
            content script should be added and js is an array of the JS files
            to be loaded.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            Now inside the same directory create a main.js file and add the
            following code:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code
                data-id="code-animation" class="hljs javascript"  data-trim data-line-numbers>
                alert("The test extension is up and running")
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            Now reload the extension and when you visit any URLs you will see
            an alert message.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How to Customize Your Browser Extension</h2>
          <p>Now let's have some more fun with our extension.</p>
          <p>
            What we are going to do now is create a web extension that changes
            all the images of a webpage we visit to an image we choose.
          </p>
          <p></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            For this, just add any image to the current directory and change
            the main.js file to:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code
                data-id="code-animation" class="hljs javascript"  data-trim data-line-numbers>
                console.log("The extension is up and running");
  
                var images = document.getElementsByTagName('img')
  
                for (elt of images) {
                  elt.src = `${browser.runtime.getURL("pp.jpg")}`
                  elt.alt = 'an alt text'
                }
              </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>
            Where can it be used? Interesting question. Maybe for people with
            special needs
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>
            I almost forgot. You still need to make changes to the file
            manifest.json here
          </p>
          <pre>
                <code

        <section>
          <h2>How to add a toolbar button to your extension</h2>
          <p>
            Now we'll add a button located in the toolbar of your browser.
            Users can interact with the extension using this button.
          </p>
          <p>
            To add a toolbar button, add the following lines to the

          </p>
          <pre>
            <code data-id="code-animation" class="hljs javascript"  data-trim data-line-numbers>
              function openTab(){
      
                var newTab = browser.tabs.create({
                  url:'https://github.com/Zelenskiy',
                  active:true
                })
              }
              
              browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(openTab)
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Now reload the extension!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>
            Whenever someone clicks the button, it calls the openTab function
            which opens a new tab with the URL that links to my github.
            Also, the active key, when set to true, makes the newly
            created tab the current tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that you can use APIs provided by browsers in the background
            script.
